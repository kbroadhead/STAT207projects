# STAT207projects
This repository contains (the) 4 projects done for the Winter 2020 STA 207: Statistical methods for Research course at UC Davis. Below is a brief summary of each project. Additional information concerning the scope and aims of each project is contained within the relevant writeup project writeup. Thanks to Koral Buch, Nanhao Chen, and Min Kim, my project partners for the duration of this course. 

Project 1 concerns analysis of data from the highly studied Tennessee Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio study (Project STAR). The analysis studies the effect of class size on math scores for first graders using a One-Way ANOVA model. The data set can be found in the AER package in R. 

Project 2 concerns an extension of project 1. In this setting we use a Two-Way ANOVA model to study the effects of class size on math scores (again for first graders) with the school as the secondary factor. Additionally, the potential for causal inference is discussed and evaluated.

Project 3 concerns analysis of traffic fatality data for 48 US states from 1982 to 1988. Again, the data can be found in the AER package in R. Our analysis investigates the associations between several covariates and traffic fatalities, and, in particular, whether any causal link between mandatory jail sentences and traffic fatalities can be asserted.

Project 4 concerns construction of predictive models using data from the MCI Machine Learning Repository. More specifically, we study retail banking market data, and investigate the potential for predicting whether a subject will sign on to a long-term bank deposit given a number of covariates. The "Project4_FinalProject" files contain a sightly expanded version of project 4.
